This code performs cell counting and size distribution analysis and dumps results into a csv file.
It uses watershed segmentation for better segmentation, separating touching nuclei.

#STEP 1: Sude background 
#Now we know that the regions at the center of cells is for sure cells
#The region far away is background.
#We need to extract sure regions. For that erode a few times. 
#But we have cells touching, so erode alone will not work. 
#To separate touching objects, the best approach would be distance transform and then thresholding.

# let us start by identifying sure background area
# dilating pixes a few times increases cell boundary to background. 
# This way whatever is remaining for sure will be background. 
#The area in between sure background and foreground is our ambiguous area. 
#Watershed should find this area for us.

#distance their respective distances from the closest 0 value (boundary).

#Now we create a marker and label the regions inside. 
# For sure regions, both foreground and background will be labeled with positive numbers.
# Unknown regions will be labeled 0. 
#For markers let us use ConnectedComponents. 
#Connected components labeling scans an image and groups its pixels into components 
#based on pixel connectivity, i.e. all pixels in a connected component share 
#similar pixel intensity values and are in some way connected with each other. 
#Once all groups have been determined, each pixel is labeled with a graylevel 
# or a color (color labeling) according to the component it was assigned to.

#One problem rightnow is that the entire background pixels is given value 0.
#This means watershed considers this region as unknown.
#So let us add 10 to all labels so that sure background is not 0, but 10
markers = markers+10

# Now, mark the region of unknown with zero
